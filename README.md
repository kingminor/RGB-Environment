# RGB-Enviorment
This is a project to increase the gaming experience by enhancing the environment it is played it.

Hello
In gaming, environment is everything. Upgrading from standard to surround sound is everything. So I am trying to improve the environment to bring it outside of the screen. This program will take any screen, find the most common pixel is a certain section, and send that value to an assiangeable LED. This project is still in its infancy and I am terrible at coding. So I need people to help. If you have experience coding in python, please leave a comment, any help is greatly appreciated.
